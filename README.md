> The Basic Login App built with Flutter provides a simple and intuitive interface for user authentication. Users can enter their credentials (username and password) to log in, with input validation and basic error handling. The app demonstrates core Flutter concepts like form handling, state management, and navigation. It can be easily extended to integrate with back-end services for user authentication and data storage.
